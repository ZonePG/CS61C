# CS61C
**CS 61C focus on Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures)**

I choose [course website (2020 summer)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su20/) as the study material.

Lab 9: SIMD Instructions, Lab 10: Thread Level Parallelism I choose 2022 spring material and code. They correspond to lab8 and lab9 in 22sp.

Lab 11: Spark / Dependability, Project 4: Numc need hive environment, these haven't been finished yet.
